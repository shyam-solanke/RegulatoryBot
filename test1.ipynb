This test [does not/may not, as ap -\\npropriate] detect all genetic variants  \\nrelated to a given disease, and the ab -\\nsence of a variant tested does not rule  \\nout the presence of other genetic  \\nvariants that may be related to the dis -\\nease.  \\n(B) The limiting statement explain -\\ning that other companies offering a ge -\\nnetic risk test may be detecting dif -\\nferent genetic variants for the same  disease, so the user may get different  \\nresults using a test from a different  \\ncompany.  \\n(C) The limiting statement explain -\\ning that other factors such as environ -\\nmental and lifestyle risk factors may  \\naffect the risk of developing a given  \\ndisease.  \\n(D) The limiting statement explain -\\ning that some people may feel anxious  \\nabout getting genetic test health re -\\nsults.

An individual may at the same time, or after receiving notification that such a record about him exists, requests that he be given access to the record. \\n(b) An individual desiring notifica-\\ntion or access to records shall mail or deliver a request for records in any Food and Drug Administration Privacy Act Records System to the FDA Pri-vacy Act Coordinator (address is lo-cated on the agency web site at http:// \\nwww.gov.fda ). \\n(c) Requests shall be in writing and \\nshall name the Privacy Act Record System or Systems concerning which the individual requests notification of whether there are records about him that are retrieved by reference to his name or other personal identifier. To help assure a prompt response, an indi-vidual should indicate that he is mak-ing a ‘‘Privacy Act Request’’ on the en-velope and in a prominent manner in the letter. \\n(d) An individual who merely wishes \\nto be notified whether a Privacy Act Record System contains a record about him ordinarily need not provide any verification of his identity other than his name. The mere fact that the Food and Drug Administration has a record about an individual in any of its Pri-vacy Act Records Systems would not be likely to constitute a clearly unwar-ranted invasion of personal privacy.
